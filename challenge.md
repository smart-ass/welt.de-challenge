### Coding Challenge:

"Fetch asynchronous data from an API".
Your task is to write a script or app, which gathers data from two endpoints asynchronously, merges the responses and displays them in any way, like a browser or console output.
 
For example you could use these two endpoints:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 to obtain a user's data
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1 to obtain all comments written by that user
 
If you find a straightforward solution for the 'problem', even better. 
We would like to see, what you achieve within 2 hours timeboxed and how you approach the challenge.
If you have time left over, we are happy if you improve your solution in a direction that you think fits the challenge.
We are looking forward to speak with you about your solution.
 
Please submit your solution via GitHub and commit frequently.
